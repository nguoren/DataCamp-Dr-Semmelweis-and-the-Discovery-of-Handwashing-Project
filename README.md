## Project Tasks
1. Load in the dataset with the yearly number of deaths
2. Calculate the yearly proportion of deaths
3. Plot the yearly proportion of deaths for both clinics
4. Load in the dataset with the monthly number of deaths
5. Plot the monthly proportion of deaths
6. Make a plot that highlights the effect of handwashing
7. Calculate the average reduction in proportion of deaths due to handwashing
8. Make a bootstrap analysis of the difference in mean monthly proportion of deaths

## Insights Gathered
1. There were 2 clinics at Vienna General Hospital responsible for delivering babies; Clinic 1 & 2
2. 1846 was the year that recorded the highest deaths for both clinics
3. Clinic 1 had higher proportion of deaths with the highest at 15.8%
4. Handwashing was made mandatory from 1847 and deaths were reduced drastically
5. On average, handwashing reduced deaths by 8%
